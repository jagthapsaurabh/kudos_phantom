## ⚡ PHANTOM v3 — What's New

| Area | v2.5 | v3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Entries | RSI reversal only | **+ Momentum continuation setup** (MACD-hist zero-cross with DI confirmation, in 4h trend direction) |
| Drawdown control | none | **Portfolio DD throttle**: size cut at soft DD, entry halt at hard DD, auto-resume |
| Stops | ATR SL + trailing | **+ breakeven stop** once trade is `breakeven_atr` x ATR in profit |
| Cooldown | configured but unused | **enforced** after every closed trade |
| Overlapping trades | silently overwritten | guarded; optional close-&-reverse (`allow_reverse`) |
| Trade log | 14 fields | **30+ fields**: signal candle, entry candle, setup, candle type, 4h trend, RSI/MACD-hist/ADX/ATR/EMA snapshot and every filter's pass/fail |
| Optimizer | none | `optimize_phantom.py`: staged grid + greedy risk tuning with Calmar-style objective and out-of-sample validation |

### Run the tuned v3 backtest + full trade log

```bash
# from the repo root
python -m backend.app.scripts.run_phantom_v3        # uses backend/logs/champion_config.json if present
python -m backend.app.scripts.optimize_phantom      # re-tune parameters (writes champion_config.json)
```

The trade log is written to `backend/logs/phantom_v3_trades.csv` — one row per trade with the
exact signal candle, execution candle, all indicator values and every entry condition as it
stood at that moment. The same snapshot is also persisted per trade in the `trades` table and
returned by `GET /backtest/results/{run_id}`.

All v3 behaviours are config-driven (`PhantomV2Config`); every new flag defaults to the exact
v2.5 behaviour, so the API, paper trader and live trader remain fully backward compatible.
